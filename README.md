# Simple Cooler Heater PID Controller

> This **fork** of the original [simple_pid_controller](https://github.com/bvweerd/simple_pid_controller) enhances its functionality by adding support for a **Cooling Mode** and the ability to select a custom **output entity**.  
>  
> The Simple PID Controller is a Home Assistant integration that provides real-time PID control with a user-friendly interface for tuning and diagnostics.

---

### Cooling Mode

- In **Cooling Mode**, the PID output is **inverted**, allowing the controller to regulate systems where **decreasing** the control variable is needed  
  (e.g., turning on a fan to reduce temperature), rather than increasing it as in heating mode.

- ‚úÖ The new feature is fully compatible with the existing configuration.

- Introduces a **UI switch** (`cooling_mode`) to toggle between heating and cooling behavior **dynamically**.

---

### Use Cases

This enhancement is especially useful for scenarios such as:  
- Active cooling of enclosures  
- Temperature-regulated fan control  
- Other inverse-response systems

## üîß Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. In Home Assistant UI, navigate to **HACS > Integrations**
2. Click the three-dot menu (‚ãÆ) and select **Custom repositories**
3. Add:
   ```text
   https://github.com/kriptos1970/simple_cooler_heater_pid
   ```
   Select **Integration** as type
4. Search for **Simple PID Controller** and install
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy `simple_cooler_heater_pid` to `/config/custom_components/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Removal Instructions 
To remove the Simple PID Controller, navigate to **Settings > Devices & Services**, select **Simple PID Controller**, and click **Delete**. If installed manually, delete the `custom_components/simple_cooler_heater_pid` directory and restart Home Assistant.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The controller is configured through the UI using the Config Flow {% term config_flow %}.

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration** and choose **Simple PID Controller**
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: e.g., "Heater Controller"
   - **Sensor Entity**: e.g., `sensor.living_room_temperature`
4. Submit and finish setup

**Default Range:**  
The controller‚Äôs setpoint range defaults to **0.0 ‚Äì 100.0**. To customize this range, select the integration in **Settings > Devices & Services**, click **Options**, adjust **Range Min** and **Range Max**, and save.

## üéØ PID Tuning Guide

A PID controller continuously corrects the difference between a **setpoint** and **measured value** using:

- **P (Proportional)**: reacts to present error
- **I (Integral)**: compensates for past error
- **D (Derivative)**: predicts future error trends

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Manual (Trial & Error)</strong></summary>

1. Set `Ki` and `Kd` to 0
2. Start with small `Kp` (e.g., 1.0)
3. Increase `Kp` until oscillations appear
4. Halve that `Kp` value
5. Increase `Ki` to reduce steady-state error
6. Add `Kd` to smooth out oscillations

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Ziegler‚ÄìNichols Method</strong></summary>

1. Set `Ki = 0`, `Kd = 0`, increase `Kp` until sustained oscillations
2. Measure:
   - **Ku** = critical gain
   - **Pu** = oscillation period
3. Apply:
   - `Kp = 0.6 √ó Ku`
   - `Ki = 1.2 √ó Ku / Pu`
   - `Kd = 0.075 √ó Ku √ó Pu`

</details>

### How it works in practice

1. **Initialization**  
   - On startup (or when options change), we set up a single `sample_time` value (in seconds).  
   - We register a periodic callback with Home Assistant‚Äôs scheduler (`async_track_time_interval` or `DataUpdateCoordinator`) using that same `sample_time`.  

2. **Coordinator Tick**  
   - Every `sample_time` seconds, Home Assistant‚Äôs scheduler invokes our update method.  
   - We immediately read the current process variable (e.g. temperature sensor) and pass it to the PID logic.

3. **PID Logic & Output**  
   - The PID algorithm calculates the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative terms and writes the result to your target entity (e.g. a heater or set-point).

4. **Adjusting Sample Time**
   - Changing `sample_time` in your integration options takes effect at the end of the current interval‚Äîno Home Assistant restart is required.  
   - On the next tick, the coordinator will use the new interval.
